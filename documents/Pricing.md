# Pricing

<p align="justify">Both options offer competitive prices in different ways depending on the needs of each client. Throughout time, they have been able to provide new and innovative discount options, provide additional instances, and drop billing increments. However, as costs decrease, complexity increases. Here are some is the comparison of the billing characteristics that affect the way each one of them is priced: </p>

Before, going into this though, it’s important to understand the standard billing models for Cloud providers:

- <p align="justify">Subscription-based: services are charged based on a cloud catalog and cloud customers typically pay upfront, prior to receiving access to cloud services. Prices are often based on the subscription's length and a longer subscription often translates to a lower cost. Subscribers are billed for all the resources to which they are subscribed, even if they’re used or not. </p>

  - <p align="justify">Enterprise billing service: number of active users assigned to a particular cloud subscription</p>

- <p align="justify">Pay-as-you-go: Billing is done according to the services and resources used in the course of time. This is a good option if long-term and binding contracts want to be avoided. </p>


## Subscriptions

Azure and AWS offer different kinds of subscriptions: 

For Azure:
-  Free Subscription (see below) 

-  <p align="justify">Azure Student subscription: the same idea as the free trial but it's directed to students, it lasts for 12 months and US $100 credit is given </p>
-  <p align="justify">Azure Enterprise Agreement: provides flexibility for enterprise level clients to get software licenses and services with included discounts. It's the consensus in the market that Microsoft Azure is, over Amazon Web Services (AWS), the most trusted   cloud for enterprise and hybrid infrastructure.</p>

For AWS: 
-  Free Tier (see below) 

-  <p align="justify">AWS Educate: a grant program for educators, academic researchers and students. Recipients are provided with service credits for an active AWS account.</p>

## Free Tier/Subscription Service

Both AWS and Azure offer a ‘free tier’ service for new and initial subscribers.

<p align="justify">AWS allows subscribers to try out most its services free for a year, including RDS, S3, EC2, Elastic Block Store, Elastic Load Balancing (EBS), etc. This will allow, for example, to use EC2 and EBS on the free tier to host a website for a whole year. This due to the fact that EBS pricing will be zero unless usage exceeds the limit of 30GB of storage and EC2 allows 730 hours of a t2.micro instance.</p>

<p align="justify">Azure’s free tier works similarly.  Services like App Service, Virtual Machines, Azure SQL Database, Blob Storage and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) are free for the initial period of 12 months. It offers a US $200 credit for other services. Azure also provides the Functions (Serverless - FaaS) service at 1 million requests free every month throughout the subscription.</p>

## Pay-as-you-go

<p align="justify">AWS mainly provides this as its pricing service and they charge use per hour while Azure charges per minute of use. Both offer the following sub-models to adapt to clients’ different needs:</p> 

- **On demand**: <p align="justify"> The two providers offer pay-per-use without upfront cost. These instances work best for applications that have short-term, irregular workloads but critical enough as to not be interrupted. These are most useful during the testing or development phase of applications. The following table shows the cost per hour and per GB of memory given instances in varying levels of computing power:</p> 

| VM Type                       | AWS OD Hourly | Azure OD Hourly | AWS OD / GB RAM | Azure OD / GB RAM |
