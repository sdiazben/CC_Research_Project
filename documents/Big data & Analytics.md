# Big data & Analytics

<p align="justify">Within a world where data is becoming more dense, variable and quickly growing; the necessity to provide services related to this, has also permeated the catalogue of these to providers. Both offer an extensive amount of services, so this section will focus on the main ones. The following chart shows characteristics and important contrasts that they share:</p>

Service | AWS | Azure | Comparison
--------| ----| ------| ----------
**Data processing** | <a href= "https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/emr/"> Elastic MapReduce </a> | <a href=     "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/"> HDInsight </a> |<p align="justify"> Built upon Hadoop, and can be hooked to other platforms: Spark, Storm, and Kafka. AWS has proven to have a better pricing for this tool. Azure has proven to have an advantage with its linkage to end-user tools like Excel.</p>
**Data orchestration** |<a href= "https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/data-pipeline/">Data Pipeline</a></br><br><a href= "https://aws.amazon.com/glue/">AWS Glue</a></br>|<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/">Data Factory</a></br><br><a href= "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-catalog/">Data Catalog</a></br>|<p align="justify">ETL services, complete with the ability to build a data catalog.</br><br>AWS Data Pipeline as a platform for data migration between different AWS compute and storage services, and also between on premise and AWS instances while Azure's Data Factory is more of an integration service for orchestrating and automating the movement and transformation of data.</br> </p>
**Real-time Analytics** | <a href= "https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/kinesis/"> Kinesis Analytics </a>|<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/">Stream Analytics</a></br><br><a href= "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-lake-analytics/">Data Lake Analytics</a></br><br><a href= "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-lake-store/">Data Lake Store</a></br>|<p align="justify">Real-time streaming analytics.</br><br>AWS provides all-in-one while Azure needs three (3) services.</br> </p>
**Data visualization** | <a href= "https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/quicksight/"> QuickSight </a> | <a href= "https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">PowerBI</a>|<p align="justify">Both provide graphical representation of information (charts, graphs, and maps).</br><br>PowerBI has been longer in the market, with QuickSight being relatively new. It is the consensus Power BI is richer in features, AWS QuickSight is simple to use.</br> </p>
**Search** | <a href= "https://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/">CloudSearch</a></br><br><a href= "https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/elasticsearch-service/">Elasticsearch</a></br>|<a href= "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/">Azure Search</a></br><br><a href= "https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?page=1&search=Elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a></br>|<p align="justify">Set up, manage, and scale a search solution for a website or application.</br><br>Both rely on <a href= "https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> open source platform</br><br>They main difference might be on the number of languages supported: AWS supports 34 and Azure 56.</br></p>
