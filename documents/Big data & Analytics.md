# Big data & Analytics

<p align="justify">Within a world where data is becoming more dense, variable and quickly growing; the necessity to provide services related to this, has also permeated the catalogue of these to providers. Both offer an extensive amount of services, so this section will focus on the main ones. The following chart shows characteristics and important contrasts that they share:</p>

Service | AWS | Azure | Comparison

AWS has proven to have a better pricing for this tool. Azure has proven to have an advantage with its linkage to end-user tools like Excel.</p>
